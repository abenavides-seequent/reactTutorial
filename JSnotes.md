## JavaScript Notes

### Variable Types
* Var - is visible everywhere (ex. defined in for loop declaration -> visible outside loop)
* let - is not visible everywhere but can be changed
* const - not intended to be changed


### Comparisons
* == - type coercion (ex. 123 == '123' -> true)
* === - no type coercion (ex. 123 === '123' -> false)


## Control Statements
* same while, do-while, and for loop as C and Java
* Ternery operator for conditional expressions:  (ex. const allowed = (age > 18) ? 'yes' : 'no'    )
